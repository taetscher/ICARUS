## Acknowledgements

True to the scientific method, this project would not have been possible without being able to
'stand on the shoulders of giants'. Many of the components used were already available freely.
Most notably inspiration came from...


   ...the very instructive [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/), 
   
   ...the ingenious [Mark Jay's YOLO Series](https://github.com/markjay4k/YOLO-series),
   
   ...as well as [the official YOLO Webpage](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/).
